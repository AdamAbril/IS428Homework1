The purpose of this repository is to store Python code that was used to analyze and visualize Baltimore 911 reported crime data.
In the code, you are able to see some preprocessing steps, a dataset profile, and various visualizations (bar charts and heat maps)
that display the crime data based on some measure of time, location, and/or crime type.
